# PaymentReportAPI

The API takes payment data JSON with various attributes, converts them into a unified report, and then returns them to the user as JSON.
The API also integrates with the https://api.nbp.pl/ to convert payment data in foreign currency to PLN.

4. Check if there are no errors with:

```
5. Run the server one the desired port (eg. 8000) with:

```
